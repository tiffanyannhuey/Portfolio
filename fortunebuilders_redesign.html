      <h1>Borsheims Share/Email Wishlist Functionality</h1>
      <p>Borsheims wanted their customers to have the ability to share their wishlists via social media and email.</p>
      <p>There are two conditions for the wishlist. If the wishlist is made public, then on click it would send the wishlist information to whichever channel they wanted to share it on. If the wishlist is private and the customer attempts to share, they would be notified to make the wishlist public in order to share. </p>
      <p>The email portion is tied with the Coupon module, which generates a unique coupon code associated with a Price Group. When the form is filled out, the coupon code along with all the field information is sent to a php file on the server which triggers the email and writes the coupon code to a csv file, which is then imported back into the admin via a feed to tie the coupon to the price group.</p>
