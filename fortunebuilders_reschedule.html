      <h1>Fortune Builders Call Reschedule Project</h1>
      <p>When a student enrolls in a Mastery program, they are eligible to book calls with different coaches. Some of these call types are student-facing calls that are able to be booked in the Fortune Builders LMS (Learning Management System). Other phone calls can be booked by a coach or administrator via the admin dashboard. Regardless, if a student needed to reschedule a call it was currently handled outside the system via the Support department, resulting in missed rescheduled calls and "lost sheep". The stakeholders wanted to improve student retention by giving them the ability to reschedule calls within the LMS interface. Upon cancellation, the student would be emailed a one-time token to reschedule the call:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>If it was a student-facing call, the student can book the call with any available coach/time as long as it was the same call type (Real Estate Calls, Internet Quickstart Calls)</li>
          <li>If it was an internal call (non-student-facing), the student would be able to view the internal call type on the student-facing calendar, filtered by the specific coach for the original call.</li>
          <li>If the student's access to that call type was expired, they would be shown a greyed out calendar with a modal prompt to renew their subscription.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The call reschedule project needed to work for different users of the LMS. Coaches and admins also needed functionality to reschedule calls on the student's behalf via the admin dashboard. Students should be able to reschedule alls via the student-facing coaching calendar. Additionally, there are multiple widgets throughout the LMS which needed to display call status for any call scheduled/rescheduled/cancelled and rescheduled/ cancelled without reschedule.</p> 
      <p>Technologies used: Wordpress, PHP, Javascript/Typescript, Angular, Bootstrap</p>
